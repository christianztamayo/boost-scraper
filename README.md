# boost-scraper

Used for scraping size.co.uk for Adidas Boost shoes back when Adidas was the hype train in the footwear industry and any pair of shoes that has [Boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_(material)) were really hard to get.

Just a simple interval scraper, nothing out of the ordinary. Had a chance to play with `ESLint`, `chalk`, `ora`, and `cheerio` in this project.
